## 🚀 Project Overview

The Deakin Rover is designed and built by the [Deakin Competitive Robotics Club](https://www.instagram.com/deakinrobotics) for the **[Australian Rover Challenge (ARC)](https://www.australianroverchallenge.com.au/)**, Australia's premier university rover competition. Teams design, build, and operate rovers through a series of field tasks including terrain traversal, equipment servicing, autonomous navigation, and science sample retrieval.

This repository contains the full software stack of Deakin Rover Borealis for the 2026 competition entry: onboard Jetson Nano software, base station ROS2 workspace, and the web-based operator dashboard built with Next.js — all containerised with Docker.

---

## 🏗 System Architecture

The rover runs a self-contained ROS2 stack on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano. The operator connects via a Next.js web GUI over Wi-Fi with no ROS2 installation required on the operator's PC.

> **Note on `dcr_base_station/base_station_ws/` and `dcr_base_station/.devcontainer/`:** These exist solely for local development and GUI testing. They allow a developer without access to the physical rover to spin up an Ubuntu + ROS2 Jazzy container running the same nodes as the Jetson, so the GUI can be validated end-to-end on a laptop. They are **not** part of the competition architecture and are **not** deployed on-site.

```

> **Development tool — Foxglove Studio + `foxglove_bridge` (:8765):** During development and field testing, Foxglove Studio connected to the rover via `foxglove_bridge` to visualise the robotic arm URDF in real time, giving the team a live digital twin of the arm. This was used to verify joint positions and ensure no arm segment was colliding with the chassis or other parts of the rover during operation. Foxglove is **not** required to run the system in competition.

**Operator PC (`dcr_base_station/gui/` only):**

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    gui["Next.js GUI\nlocalhost:3000"]
    gui -- "roslib.js WebSocket" --> rb["rover IP:9090\nrosbridge_server"]
    gui -- "MJPEG HTTP" --> cam["rover IP:8080 / :8090 / :8091\nmjpg_streamer"]
```

The Jetson Docker container (`dustynv/ros:jazzy-desktop-r36.4.0-cu128-24.04`, CUDA 12.8-optimised) is the only containerised ROS2 environment used in competition.

## 🛠 Getting Started

Setup involves several prerequisite steps — installing the PEAK CAN driver, patching the Linux kernel for multi-camera USB support, connecting and configuring cameras, installing Docker, VS Code, and the Dev Containers extension — before the ROS2 workspace can be built and launched.

<!-- Full step-by-step instructions are in the documentation:

### Acknowledgements

#### 2025 Foundations

- **Lachlan Carboon** <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lachlancarboon/"><img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=linkedin" height="20" alt="LinkedIn"/></a> — co-founded the [Deakin Competitive Robotics Club](https://www.instagram.com/deakinrobotics) and started the rover project at Deakin University. He signed the team up for the Australian Rover Challenge, introduced it to Deakin students, built the first team, and submitted the first competition documents in 2025 — without him, none of this exists.
- **Matt Davison** <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-davison0167/"><img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=linkedin" height="20" alt="LinkedIn"/></a> — designed the original rover from the ground up in 2025, enabling Deakin's first-ever entry at the Australian Rover Challenge. The full mechanical design — chassis, suspension, and wheels — was his work, and the 2026 build is built directly on top of it.
- **Jatan Vadgama** <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jvadgama/"><img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=linkedin" height="20" alt="LinkedIn"/></a> *(Mechanical Team Lead, ARC 2025)* — took Matt's design, made key modifications, and assembled the complete rover for the 2025 competition. His mechanical engineering and creativity were instrumental in the 2025 build cycle. The 2026 team used the chassis and suspension he assembled and redesigned only the wheels.
- **Nathan** <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-belvedere/"><img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=linkedin" height="20" alt="LinkedIn"/></a> — the drivetrain motor control system is built on top of the electrical design and codebase Nathan developed for the 2025 competition. His work on RS485 motor interfacing and the Linux kernel patch for multi-camera USB support laid the foundation for this year's software.

#### Open Source

- **[mjpg-streamer](https://github.com/jacksonliam/mjpg-streamer)** — open source MJPEG streaming used for all three camera feeds.
- **[nobleo/nobleo_socketcan_bridge](https://github.com/nobleo/nobleo_socketcan_bridge)** — C++20 SocketCAN ↔ ROS2 bridge used for CAN bus communication with arm motors.
